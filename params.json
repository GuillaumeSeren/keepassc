That is, your\r\npassword database is fully encrypted with AES.\r\n\r\nKeePassC is written in Python 3 and comes with a curses-interface. It is completely controlled\r\nwith the keyboard.\r\n\r\nInstall:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIf all dependencies are fulfilled type 'python setup.py install' in the root directory of KeePassC.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n------\r\n\r\nStart the program with 'keepassc'. To get help type 'F1' while KeePassC is executed and you will see usage\r\ninformation to the current window (not in main menu).\r\n\r\nA small commandline interface is available, too. Type 'keepassc -h'.\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n* Python 3 (>=3.3)\r\n* kppy http://www.nongnu.org/kppy\r\n* xsel (optional but necessary if you want to copy usernames and passwords to clipboard)  http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/\r\n* A POSIX-compatible operating system\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 Karsten-Kai König <kkoenig@posteo.de>\r\n\r\nKeePassC is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms\r\nof the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,\r\neither version 3 of the License, or at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nKeePassC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY\r\nWARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR\r\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
