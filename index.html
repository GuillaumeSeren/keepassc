</ul><h2>Features:</h2>

<p>KeePassC is a password manager fully compatible to KeePass v.1.x and KeePassX. That is, your
password database is fully encrypted with AES.</p>

<p>KeePassC is written in Python 3 and comes with a curses-interface. It is completely controlled
with the keyboard.</p>

<h2>Install:</h2>

<p>If all dependencies are fulfilled type 'python setup.py install' in the root directory of KeePassC.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>

<p>Start the program with 'keepassc'. To get help type 'F1' while KeePassC is executed and you will see usage
information to the current window (not in main menu).</p>

<p>A small commandline interface is available, too. Type 'keepassc -h'.</p>
